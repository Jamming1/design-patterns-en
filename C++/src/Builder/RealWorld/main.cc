/**
 * Real World Example for the Builder Design Pattern (C++03/11 Evolution)
 *
 * Need: Consider a representation of the Document Object Model in which each
 * HTML element is a non-trivial graph (multi-way tree) structure whose
 * construction is complicated by the need to add an arbitrary number of
 * children to the root.
 *
 * Solution: A HTML ElementBuilder can be used for stepwise construction of an
 * Element using an implementational variant of the Builder Design Pattern known
 * as the \e Fluent Builder. Although modern C++17/20/23 provides the neccesary
 * built-in language mechanics (i.e. initializer_list and parameter packs) for a
 * Builder, this specific \e Fluent Builder is a class that can be applied to
 * legacy code relying on the older C++03/11 standards.

 * same technique. However, this approach is for only demonstration purposes in
 * order to show the subtle difference in the C++03- and C++11-subvariants of

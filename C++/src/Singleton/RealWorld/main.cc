/**
 * Real World Example of the Singleton Design Pattern
 *
 * Need: Consider a (large) program that must implement its own internal logging
 * functionality with a global logger object. Suppose that all log messages are
 * required to be printed in order even if the logger is called across multiple
 * concurrent threads or processes. Furthermore, the logger should have some
 * sort of flag to specify and ignore messages below a certain level.
 *
 * Solution: A thread-safe Logger class can be implemented using the Scott
 * Meyers' Singleton pattern. The Singleton pattern is the recommended solution
 * if indeed there must be a single global instance of the Logger class.
 * However, in modern practices, the addition of a new singleton to a codebase
 * could be regarded as a design flaw with the singleton itself being a design
 * anti-pattern. Nevertheless, the following presents a Logger Singleton as a
 * commonly appearing use case of the pattern in the C++ literature.

/**
 * The Logger Singleton Class
 *
 * In this (zero handle objects) implementation of the Scott Meyers' Singleton,
 * the constructor and destructor are private methods and the move/copy
 * constructors and assignment operations are explicitly deleted. In essence,
 * the program itself cannot directly create an instance of the Logger class,
 * and instead the static instance() member function must be used to access it.
 *
 * The public API of this Logger has two main callbacks: (1) set the level of
 * the Logger; and (2) log a message at given level. For convenience, these two
 * client-facing methods wrap around the instance() member function in a thread-
 * safe fashion. An integral counter member is also included to demonstrate that
 * the message ordering is preserved.
 *
 * Note the final keyword specifier prevents inheritance, that is, it is not
 * possible to extend this Logger Singleton and override its class methods.
